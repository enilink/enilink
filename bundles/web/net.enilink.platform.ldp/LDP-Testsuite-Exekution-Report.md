 BasicContainer-4xxErrorHasResponseBody                   | [SHOULD]   | LDP servers SHOULD provide a corresponding response body containing information about which properties could not be persisted. The format of the 4xx response body is not constrained by LDP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 BasicContainer-ContentTypeHeader                         | [SHOULD]   | LDP servers SHOULD use the Content-Type request header to determine the representation format when the request has an entity body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 BasicContainer-OptionsAllowHeader                        | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST indicate their support for HTTP Methods by responding to a HTTP OPTIONS request on the LDPR&rsquo;s URL with the HTTP Method tokens in the HTTP response header Allow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 BasicContainer-RequestedInteractionModelHeaders          | [MUST]     | LDP servers that successfully create a resource from a RDF representation in the request entity body MUST honor the client's requested interaction model(s). The created resource can be thought of as an RDF named graph [rdf11-concepts]. If any model cannot be honored, the server MUST fail the request.                                                                                                                          
 MemberResource-OptionsAllowHeader                        | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST indicate their support for HTTP Methods by responding to a HTTP OPTIONS request on the LDPR&rsquo;s URL with the HTTP Method tokens in the HTTP response header Allow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 MemberResource-GetResourceAsTurtleNoAccept               | [SHOULD]   | LDP servers should respond with a text/turtle representation of the requested LDP-RS whenever the Accept request header is absent [turtle].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 BasicContainer-ContainsRdfType                           | [SHOULD]   | LDP-RSs representations SHOULD have at least one rdf:type set explicitly. This makes the representations much more useful to client applications that don&rsquo;t support inferencing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 BasicContainer-ETagHeadersGet                            | [MUST]     | LDP server responses MUST use entity tags (either weak or strong ones) as response ETag header values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 MemberResource-ContainsRdfType                           | [SHOULD]   | LDP-RSs representations SHOULD have at least one rdf:type set explicitly. This makes the representations much more useful to client applications that don&rsquo;t support inferencing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 BasicContainer-AcceptPostResponseHeader                  | [MUST]     | LDP servers that support POST MUST include an Accept-Post response header on HTTP OPTIONS responses, listing post document media type(s) supported by the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 MemberResource-ConditionFailedStatusCode                 | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST respond with status code 412 (Condition Failed) if ETags fail to match when there are no other errors with the request [HTTP11]. LDP servers that require conditional requests MUST respond with status code 428 (Precondition Required) when the absence of a precondition is the only reason for rejecting the request [RFC6585].                                                                                   
 MemberResource-GetResponseHeaders                        | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST support the HTTP response headers defined in section 4.2.8 HTTP OPTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 BasicContainer-PutToCreate                               | [MAY]      | LDP servers MAY choose to allow the creation of new resources using HTTP PUT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 BasicContainer-DeleteRemovesContainmentTriple            | [MUST]     | When an LDPR identified by the object of a containment triple is deleted, the LDPC server MUST also remove the LDPR from the containing LDPC by removing the corresponding containment triple.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 BasicContainer-ResponsePropertiesNotPersisted            | [SHOULD]   | LDP servers SHOULD provide a corresponding response body containing information about which properties could not be persisted. The format of the 4xx response body is not constrained by LDP. LDP servers expose these application-specific constraints as described in section 4.2.1 General.                                                                                                                                         
 BasicContainer-RestrictUriReUseSlug                      | [SHOULD]   | LDP servers that allow member creation via POST SHOULD NOT re-use URIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 BasicContainer-ConditionFailedStatusCode                 | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST respond with status code 412 (Condition Failed) if ETags fail to match when there are no other errors with the request [HTTP11]. LDP servers that require conditional requests MUST respond with status code 428 (Precondition Required) when the absence of a precondition is the only reason for rejecting the request [RFC6585].                                                                                   
 MemberResource-PutBadETag                                | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST respond with status code 412 (Condition Failed) if ETags fail to match when there are no other errors with the request [HTTP11]. LDP servers that require conditional requests MUST respond with status code 428 (Precondition Required) when the absence of a precondition is the only reason for rejecting the request [RFC6585].                                                                                   
 BasicContainer-PutReadOnlyProperties4xxStatus            | [MUST]     | If an otherwise valid HTTP PUT request is received that attempts to change properties the server does not allow clients to modify, LDP servers MUST respond with a 4xx range status code (typically 409 Conflict)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 BasicContainer-RelativeUriResolutionPost                 | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST assign the default base-URI for [RFC3987] relative-URI resolution to be the HTTP Request-URI when the resource already exists, and to the URI of the created resource when the request results in the creation of a new resource.                                                                                                                                                                                     
 MemberResource-AcceptPatchHeader                         | [MUST]     | LDP servers that support PATCH MUST include an Accept-Patch HTTP response header [RFC5789] on HTTP OPTIONS requests, listing patch document media type(s) supported by the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 BasicContainer-LdpLinkHeader                             | [MUST]     | LDP servers exposing LDPRs MUST advertise their LDP support by exposing a HTTP Link header with a target URI of http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource, and a link relation type of type (that is, rel='type') in all responses to requests made to the LDPR's HTTP Request-URI.                                                                                                                                                            
 BasicContainer-GetResource                               | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST provide an RDF representation for LDP-RSs. The HTTP Request-URI of the LDP-RS is typically the subject of most triples in the response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 BasicContainer-CreateWithoutConstraints                  | [SHOULD]   | LDP servers SHOULD allow clients to create new resources without requiring detailed knowledge of application-specific constraints. This is a consequence of the requirement to enable simple creation and modification of LDPRs. LDP servers expose these application-specific constraints as described in section 4.2.1 General.

 BasicContainer-PatchMethod                               | [SHOULD]   | LDP servers are RECOMMENDED to support HTTP PATCH as the preferred method for updating an LDPC's empty-container triples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 BasicContainer-ContainerSupportsHttpLinkHeader           | [MUST]     | LDP servers exposing LDPCs MUST advertise their LDP support by exposing a HTTP Link header with a target URI matching the type of container (see below) the server supports, and a link relation type of type (that is, rel='type') in all responses to requests made to the LDPC's HTTP Request-URI.                                                                                                                                  
 BasicContainer-PostContainer                             | [MUST]     | When a successful HTTP POST request to an LDPC results in the creation of an LDPR, a containment triple MUST be added to the state of LDPC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 MemberResource-PutRequiresIfMatch                        | [SHOULD]   | LDP clients SHOULD use the HTTP If-Match header and HTTP ETags to ensure it isn&rsquo;t modifying a resource that has changed since the client last retrieved its representation. LDP servers SHOULD require the HTTP If-Match header and HTTP ETags to detect collisions.                                                                                                                                                             
 BasicContainer-ServerHonorsSlug                          | [MAY]      | LDP servers MAY allow clients to suggest the URI for a resource created through POST, using the HTTP Slug header as defined in [RFC5023]. LDP adds no new requirements to this usage, so its presence functions as a client hint to the server providing a desired string to be incorporated into the server's final choice of resource URI.                                                                                           
 BasicContainer-JsonLdRepresentation                      | [MUST]     |  LDP servers must respond with a application/ld+json representation of the requested LDP-RS when the request includes an Accept header, unless content negotiation or Turtle support requires a different outcome [JSON-LD].

 BasicContainer-PublishConstraintsReadOnlyProp            | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST publish any constraints on LDP clients&rsquo; ability to create or update LDPRs, by adding a Link header with rel='http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#constrainedBy' [RFC5988] to all responses to requests which fail due to violation of those constraints.                                                                                                                                                                   
 MemberResource-PutReplacesResource                       | [MUST]     | If a HTTP PUT is accepted on an existing resource, LDP servers MUST replace the entire persistent state of the identified resource with the entity representation in the body of the request.

 BasicContainer-NullRelativeUriPost                       | [MUST]     | In RDF representations, LDP servers MUST interpret the null relative URI for the subject of triples in the LDPR representation in the request entity body as referring to the entity in the request body. Commonly, that entity is the model for the &ldquo;to be created&rdquo; LDPR, so triples whose subject is the null relative URI will usually result in triples in the created resource whose subject is the created resource. 
 MemberResource-Head                                      | [MUST]     | LDP servers MUST support the HTTP HEAD method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 MemberResource-PutSimpleUpdate                           | [MUST]     | LDP servers SHOULD allow clients to update resources without requiring detailed knowledge of server-specific constraints.

 BasicContainer-RestrictPutReUseUri                       | [SHOULD]   | LDP servers that allow LDPR creation via PUT SHOULD NOT re-use URIs. For RDF representations (LDP-RSs),the created resource can be thought of as an RDF named graph [rdf11-concepts].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 BasicContainer-RejectPutModifyingContainmentTriples      | [SHOULD]   | LDP servers SHOULD NOT allow HTTP PUT to update an LDPC&rsquo;s containment triples; if the server receives such a request, it SHOULD respond with a 409 (Conflict) status code.
